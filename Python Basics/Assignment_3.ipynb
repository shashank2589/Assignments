    "Functions are advantageous to have in programs because they allow you to break down a program into smaller, reusable pieces of code. This makes it easier to read and understand the code, as well as make changes and debug errors. Functions also help to modularize code, which can make it easier to test and maintain. By using functions, you can avoid duplicating code and reduce the amount of code you need to write, which can save time and effort. Overall, functions make programs more organized, efficient, and easier to work with."
